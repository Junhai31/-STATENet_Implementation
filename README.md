# A Transformer-Based Approach to Detect Suicidal Ideation Using Pre-Trained Language Models

This repository has an implementation of the paper "A Transformer-Based Approach to Detect Suicidal Ideation Using Pre-Trained Language Models." The project looks at the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures and pre-trained language models for the detection of suicidal ideation in textual data.

## Overview

Suicidal ideation detection from text is one of the important studies in mental health and social media. Traditional machine learning methods struggle to capture the contextual and semantic nuances found in the text generated by users. This project uses pre-trained transformer models to better understand the linguistic patterns in association with suicidal thoughts.

The implementation focuses on:

- Fine-tuning transformer-based models for binary classification
- Comparing performance across different pre-trained language models
- Evaluating results using standard classification metrics

## Dataset

The dataset consists of text samples labeled for suicidal ideation. Preprocessing includes text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence truncation/padding. Due to privacy and ethical concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/suicidal-ideation-transformer.git
cd suicidal-ideation-transformer
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Ethical Considerations

This project is strictly for research purposes. Predictions produced by the model should not be used as the sole basis for decision-making in relation to mental health interventions. Human supervision and professional assessment is, however, still necessary.
